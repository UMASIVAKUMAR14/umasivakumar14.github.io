description: I created a website that predicts the price of homes in Bangalore. I used Pandas and Scikit-learn to clean a dataset and develop a ML model that predicted home prices based on 6 variables. I then trained the model on a Kaggle dataset to 85% accuracy, built a Python Flask server to respond to HTTP requests, and designed & developed a UI that took user inputs for the model with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To make the site accessible anywhere, I configured an Nginx Web Server to handle HTTP requests and serve the website on an AWS EC2 instance.
