title: Adversarial Data vs Diversity Training
description: Worked in a team of 3 to investigate whether input gradient regularization and ensemble diversity training improve model robustness against adversarial attacks. We created our own adversarial dataset of the MNIST dataset using the Fast Gradient Sign Method. We then evaluated four model types in twin single and twin configurations. Surprisingly, neither regularization nor diversity training improved performance on adversarial data. This result is possibly due to the dataset's low complexity.
