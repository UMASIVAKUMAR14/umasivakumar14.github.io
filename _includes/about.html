        <p>Hi! I'm a CS major at Yale University. I am interested in creative use cases for Agentic AI, ML optimization, 
          and game development. Recently, I've done internships at start-ups like Open City Labs and corporate companies like Cotality
         (formerly Corelogic). I look forward to building more applications that drive positive change.</p>

        <p>In my free time, I read up to 30 books a year. Genres I enjoy range from science fiction to memoirs. I've also been a bharatanatyam 
          dancer for more than 10 years and lead Yale's Indian Classical Dance team. I love to take long walks, make short animations, 
          and spend quality time with my friends and family.
